# Facial Recognition Project using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project, developed in collaboration with [Ahmed Eldeeb](https://github.com/Foxdanger1412)
, focuses on facial recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implemented in MATLAB.

## Description

The goal of this project is to develop a facial recognition system using PCA, a popular dimensionality reduction technique. PCA extracts the most informative features from a set of facial images by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** A dataset of facial images is collected, which serves as the input for the facial recognition system.

2. **Preprocessing:** The facial images are preprocessed to enhance the quality and normalize the data, ensuring consistent facial feature representation.

3. **PCA Implementation:** The PCA algorithm is applied to the preprocessed facial images. It calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix to identify the most significant facial features.

4. **Feature Extraction:** The eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are selected as the principal components, representing the most discriminative facial features.

5. **Recognition and Classification:** The recognition phase involves mapping new facial images to the PCA space and comparing them with the stored principal components. The system then classifies the input image based on the nearest neighbor or another classification algorithm.

This facial recognition project using PCA aims to achieve accurate and efficient identification of individuals from facial images. It provides an opportunity to explore and analyze the application of dimensionality reduction techniques in the field of computer vision.
